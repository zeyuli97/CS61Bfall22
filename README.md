# CS61Bfall22
Self-learning CS61B.


I will update/complete all the files by following the website(https://fa22.datastructur.es/).


Thanks to Professor Josh Hug for making this great course available to study for non-UCB students.


I use GitHub as a backup for all my files and also forces me to get comfortable with Git commands.


I am a newb at CS so my code can be problematic. Please let me know if you find any mistakes, and that will be helpful since no one will grade my work.
